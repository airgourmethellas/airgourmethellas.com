Hey Replit Bot, I’m seeing three different prices for the same order as I move from Menu Selection → Review & Confirm → Final Confirmation. It looks like:

1. Menu Selection is pulling prices from the Mykonos endpoint  
2. Review & Confirm is pulling from the Thessaloniki endpoint  
3. Final Confirmation is recalculating off stale state  

Can you please:

1. **Identify and consolidate the API endpoints**  
   - Find every fetch/axios call that retrieves `price`, `priceCents`, or `deliveryFeeCents`  
   - Confirm which base URL or path (Mykonos vs Thessaloniki) it’s using  

2. **Unify to a single source of truth**  
   - Create a shared service/module (e.g. `pricingService`) that always points at the correct location based on the user’s selected delivery airport  
   - Replace all direct endpoint calls in components (`MenuSelection`, `SpecialRequests`, `ReviewConfirm`, `FinalPage`) with calls to this service  

3. **Persist selected prices in app state**  
   - Ensure selected line-item prices and fees are stored in your global state/context (or Redux store) immediately after Menu Selection  
   - Remove any local re-fetches or re-calculations downstream that ignore this stored state  

4. **Normalize and format once**  
   - In the pricingService, normalize all values to integer cents on receipt  
   - Expose a `getFormattedPrice(id)` function that returns `€xx.xx`  
   - Have every UI component call only `pricingService.getFormattedPrice(orderId)`  

5. **Write quick smoke tests or console-logs**  
   - Add a console log in each major component that prints `pricingService.currentPricing()` so we can trace exactly where the value diverges  
   - Verify that an item priced at €35.00 always prints as `35.00` on every page  

6. **Rebuild & retest**  
   - Re-run `npm run build` (or `replit run`), clear localStorage/state, and walk through an order for Mykonos vs Thessaloniki—confirm that every page now shows identical subtotals, fees, and totals.

Thanks! This will ensure one consistent price flows from selection all the way through to confirmation.```

—This will guide Replit to:

- Centralize which endpoint you hit  
- Store the prices once and pass them through your app’s state  
- Normalize/fix the currency math in one place  
- Verify with logs/tests  
- Rebuild and confirm consistency across all pages.
