1. [vite] connecting… DOMException {}
What it is: Vite’s hot-module-reload client failing to open its EventSource/WebSocket.

Impact: Just your live-reload in dev, not your payment flow. You can safely ignore this for now.

2. Failed to load Stripe.js
What it is: Your code is trying to call Stripe(…) before the Stripe client library has been loaded.

Impact: Any call to stripe.redirectToCheckout(…) or similar will throw, so even if you did authenticate, Stripe wouldn’t work yet.

Fix: In your HTML (usually index.html), add at the top of your <head>:

html
Copy
Edit
<script src="https://js.stripe.com/v3/"></script>
and then only run your const stripe = Stripe(…) code after that script tag has loaded.

3. Response status for /api/user: 401
What it is: Your front-end is calling /api/user with credentials: 'include' but the server is rejecting you as “Unauthorized.” You can see in the response headers that there’s no set-cookie happening, so you never actually get a session or token.

Impact: Your auth guard sees user == null and redirects you back to login (or just leaves you stuck), so you never get to the payment page.

Fix Checklist:

Login flow—make sure your login endpoint actually sets a cookie (or returns a token) with the proper cookie flags (HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=None if you’re on HTTPS across domains).

CORS & credentials—on your backend CORS config, allow credentials:

js
Copy
Edit
app.use(cors({
  origin: 'http://localhost:3000',   // or your frontend URL
  credentials: true
}))
Fetch call—you already have credentials: 'include', so that’s correct. Just verify in DevTools under Application → Cookies that the session cookie actually appears after login.

Test in isolation—use Postman or curl --cookie-jar cookies.txt + --cookie cookies.txt to ensure your backend will accept the cookie and return your user payload.

Bottom line
Stripe.js must be loaded before you call Stripe(…).

Your login/session cookie is never being set (hence the 401 on /api/user), so your auth context stays empty.

Once you fix the backend so that a successful login actually creates the cookie (and CORS allows it), /api/user will return 200 and your app can render the checkout page—and then Stripe will actually load and work
